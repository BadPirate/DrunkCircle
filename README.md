# Nextstrap

A simple project the way Badpirate likes it:

- Next JS
- Typescript
- Eslint (Airbnb)
- No forking semi-colons

Feel free to fork for your own project if want to make a quick web project based on the best setup available.

## Using

1. `git clone git@github.com:BadPirate/nextstrap.git MyCoolNextProject`
2. Rename the project in `package.json`
3. `yarn dev`

## Theme

Currently comes preinstalled with [Cyborg](https://bootswatch.com/cyborg/), but you can download any theme that you want to use or the default min theme.  Replacing the min'd css at `styles/bootstrap.min.css`
