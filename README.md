A simple project the way Badpirate likes it:

- Next JS
- Typescript
- Eslint (Airbnb)
- No fucking semi-colons

Feel free to fork for your own project if want to make a quick web project based on the best setup available.

To use:

1. `git clone git@github.com:BadPirate/nextstrap.git MyCoolNextProject`
2. Rename the project in `package.json`
3. There is no step 3 (except maybe writing an app)
